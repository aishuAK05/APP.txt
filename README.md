# 🛣️ Pothole Detection Using Image Segmentation

This project focuses on detecting potholes from road images using **Image Segmentation** techniques.  
By leveraging deep learning-based segmentation models, the system identifies and highlights potholes in given road images, which can help in road maintenance planning and reducing accidents.

## 📌 Project Overview
Potholes on roads are a major cause of vehicle damage and road accidents. Manual detection is time-consuming and inefficient. This project automates pothole detection using **computer vision** and **machine learning** techniques, specifically **image segmentation**, to process road images and locate potholes accurately.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Automate the process of pothole detection.
- Reduce time and manpower required for road inspection.
- Improve road safety and maintenance efficiency.
- Provide a scalable solution that can be integrated with smart city infrastructure.

---

## 📊 Dataset
- **Source:** Images of roads collected from public datasets and real-world captures.
- **Content:** Labeled road images with pothole regions annotated for segmentation tasks.
- **Preprocessing:** Images resized, normalized, and annotated in segmentation mask format.

## 🧠 Methodology
1. **Data Collection & Preprocessing**
   - Gather road images with potholes.
   - Annotate pothole regions for segmentation.
   - Resize and normalize images.

2. **Model Selection**
   - Used **YOLOv8** for object detection.
   - Applied **Custom Image Segmentation Models** to accurately highlight pothole boundaries.

3. **Training & Evaluation**
